# Curvetopia

Curvetopia is a solution to the Adobe GenSolve hackathon  of round 2 developed by our team to perform image regularization based on coordinate data from CSV files. The project focuses on smoothing and standardizing hand-drawn shapes, making them more uniform and consistent.

## Features

1. **Image Regularization:** Process and regularize hand-drawn shapes using coordinates provided in CSV files.
2. **Dataset Management:** Efficiently manage and organize coordinate data using the datasets folder.
3. **Drag and Drop:** Easily upload CSV files for processing using drag-and-drop functionality.
4. **Download Options:** Download the regularized images in both PNG and SVG formats.

## Tech Stack

1. **NumPy:** Essential for performing numerical operations and handling arrays efficiently.
2. **Matplotlib:** Used for creating plots and saving images in various formats.
3. **Scikit-learn:** Powers machine learning models and transformations, including regression and fitting algorithms.
4. **SciPy:** Supports scientific computations and optimizations, such as curve fitting.
5. **SVGwrite:** Enables the generation of SVG files for vector graphics.
6. **CairoSVG:** Converts SVG files to PNG format for image export.
7. **Pandas:** Manages and processes CSV files, providing data manipulation capabilities.
