# Curvetopia

Curvetopia is a solution to the Adobe GenSolve hackathon  of round 2 developed by our team to perform image regularization based on coordinate data from CSV files. The project focuses on smoothing and standardizing hand-drawn shapes, making them more uniform and consistent.

## Features

1. **Image Regularization:** Process and regularize hand-drawn shapes using coordinates provided in CSV files.
2. **Dataset Management:** Efficiently manage and organize coordinate data using the datasets folder.
3. **Drag and Drop:** Easily upload CSV files for processing using drag-and-drop functionality.
4. **Download Options:** Download the regularized images in both PNG and SVG formats.
